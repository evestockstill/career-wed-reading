  The Aggregation Framework is analytic tools in mongoDB allowing you to run various reports or analysis on one or more
  collections.
  Aggregation modes include 1. aggregation pipeline 2. map-reduce 3. single purpose aggregation operations

  JWT = includes alg: typ: , sub: name: iat:, signature
  you can find the user from a jsonwebtoken which will take the user id(payload) and a secret which will be kept in the .env file. You can also put an expiration on the token.
  You can make a method on your UserSchema to return a jwt.sign({ id: this._id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET) then use this method such as const token = user.getJwtToken().
  you use JWT for authorization to see once the user is logged in which access routes, and services and resources the are have access to with the token.
  An example payload ------ {
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
  }
  In authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token will be returned. Since
  tokens are credentials, great care must be taken to prevent security issues. In general, you should not keep tokens
  longer than required.
